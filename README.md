# Sugal API

This is a simple REST API that I created to practice creating REST APIs. It generates a random color from a list of colors and saves it to a file.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Run the server by running `npm start`.

## Usage

To generate a random color, make a GET request to `/color-game`. The API will return a JSON object with the color.
